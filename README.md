# Material You - Expressive Homepage

A highly personalized, feature-rich, and beautifully animated homepage designed for modern browsers, inspired by Google's Material You (M3) design language.

This project transforms the default new tab page into a dynamic, elegantly themed dashboard with persistent settings, editable favorites, and a fluid, native-like user experience. Built with minimal dependencies and designed to be incredibly fast and lightweight.
